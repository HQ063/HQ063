### Web & Desktop Developer

<img align="right" src="gonza.png">

I'm a developer from Argentina 🇦🇷 and I've been messsing around with the web 🌐 since I was 12yo 👦. I developed my first website on MS FrontPage
and I hosted it on tripod (wasn't even lycos yet). I'd like to thank to an Uruguayan 🇺🇾 guy who used the nickname of Maki Kai ⛹️‍♂️, I don't remember
his real name and I was unable to track him down, but he provided a lot of help when I was doing my first steps. If you know this guy, please send
him my gratitude ✨.

Then I took my first web development course at 15yo (I learned Flash, and it was considered the future) and after finishing high school
I went to university and started working on Desktop Development (Visual FoxPro, another oldie) while I kept improving, updating
and professionalizing on web technologies. But I don't wanna talk about my professional era, if you are interested on that part
you can visit my linkedin 👔 😀.

**TL/DR**: I'm an Internet dinosaur. 

**Currently**: Ruby Engineer @ JUUL Labs

**Hobbies**: I'm boardgame enthusiast, feel free to invite me for online playing at BGA, Boiteajeux, BGC or Yucata. I'm always @HQ063
